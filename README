1. Prepare for installation in your home directory:

  ./configure --prefix=$HOME

If you have include files in non-system places put them in CFLAGS,
and the library locations in LDFLAGS:

CXXFLAGS="-I/my/inc/dir -I/my/other/inc/dir"
LDFLAGS="-L/my/lib/dir -L/my/other/lib/dir"

Then use

  ./configure --prefix=$HOME CXXFLAGS=... LDFLAGS=...

These settings are added to the ones set in Makefile.am.

2. Compile source code:

  make

3. Install librarires:

  make install
