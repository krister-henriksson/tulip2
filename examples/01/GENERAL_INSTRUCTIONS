Typical command:

$ tulip -sf specsfile.in -gf geominfo.in -pf potinfo.in  >& tulip.out

Most important options:

     -omp               Request maximal number of threads (8) for any OpenMP parts.
     -omp_nt num        Request 'num' number of threads for any OpenMP parts. Default: 1

Required files:

(1) File containing technical specficiations for the fitting.
    Name e.g. specsfile.in
(2) File containing properties of the lattices to be fitted.
    Name e.g. geominfo.in
    This file contains paths to *.lat files, which describe the lattice.
    These files are similar to POSCAR files used by VASP.
    Commandline scripts are available for converting XYZ files to LAT files.
(3) File containing initial potential parameters and related information.
    Name e.g. potinfo.in

(4) reppot files, when using the reppot parameters. Identical to the files
    used by PARCAS.
